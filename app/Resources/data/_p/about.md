This project started as an initiative to bring more visibility for underrepresented open source developers enrolled in the [GitHub Sponsors Program](https://github.com/sponsors).

It all started a couple weeks ago when I decided to sponsor more people on the GitHub Sponsors program, which I am part of.
While browsing through the website lists made from projects I depend on, people who were featured, and other related developers, I was baffled for not finding a single women to sponsor.

Then, I decided to look for help on Twitter. This is the tweet that gave me the idea for this project:

{% twitter 1379811139291389970 %}

After the many replies in this original tweet, including people voicing concerns about the same trouble in finding underrepresented folks to sponsor, I decided to create a public list, initially pulling from the replies in that thread. 

The original list was limited thou, for including only people who identify as women. Additionally, I wanted to make this a more opt-in process. So I made a new thread:
