Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a full-stack web application developer from Brisbane, Australia.

I am passionate about open-source software, privacy, best practices, open standards, idiomatic code, user experience, and developer experience. My favourite stack these days is Laravel, Vue, and Tailwind.

In my day job I write software for the medical industry with a focus on collecting and storing highly structured clinical data using open standards. I also work at [Laravel Shift](https://laravelshift.com/) helping to create tools to improve the lives of my fellow developers.

In my spare time, I work on [rocketlog.app](https://rocketlog.app), an open-source bullet journalling app. I also enjoy making real world things like my [talking plant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=-QyKdW8opks) and making my own furniture.

I've spoken at two Laracon's, co-host the [BaseCode Podcast](https://basecodefieldguide.com/podcast/), and enjoy contributing to Laravel and other open-source projects as often as I can.

I would love to focus more on open source projects and contributions and your sponsorship would really help with that!
