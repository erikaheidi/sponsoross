I was recently diagnosed with type 1 diabetes and i am also currently working on a fork of [nightscout](http://nightscout.info), migrating to Vue.js and adding some extra features. I am also producing tutorials in various subjects and with your help i can have some more time to continue these awesome projects. Currently developing better iterations of a notifier system for low blood glucose alerts using Vonage API's.
