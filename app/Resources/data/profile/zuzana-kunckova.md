I founded [Larabelles](https://www.larabelles.com) in July 2020, hoping to create a community that was missing in the [Laravel](https://www.laravel.com) space.

There is a large gender gap within the tech industry. Technology drives social and economic change; it creates an impact on our daily lives. The fact that women, non-binary and trans developers are so under-represented is simply wrong. 

My goal is to make sure that women are present and recognized in our industry and in the companies that drive the development and the future of the Laravel community. I want Larabelles (the members of the Larabelles community) to be creating packages, products, founding companies, speaking at conferences. **I want Larabelles to be visible**. **To be known**.

Since founding Larabelles, I started a monthly newsletter, where I feature Larabelles from all over the world, sharing their stories and accomplishments. I also run giveaways and share any Larabelles related news.

I am organizing Larabelles Live Streams, a quarterly YouTube chat where I talk with other Larabelles and friends of Larabelles about how we can promote women, non-binary and trans developers, support them, encourage them to be more public about their amazing work and hopefully make a difference.

I have also started a Discord server, a safe space to chat, ask and receive help, and make new friends. Join us! https://discord.gg/z76fXucE

I love my Larabelles work and what our community stands for, and I would love for your to sponsor me as I continue making Larabelles even better! 

Thank you ðŸ’•
