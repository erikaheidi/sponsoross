Hi! My name's [Kat](https://twitter.com/maybekatz) and I'm an engineer on the [NuGet client](https://github.com/nuget/nuget.client) team at Microsoft. Before that, I was the lead maintainer/architect of the NPM CLI for like 4 years, and the author of [npx](https://npm.im/npx). I've also done a bunch of community and D&I work outside of that, along with more non-npm open source!

### What I've Done

* [npm@5](https://blog.npmjs.org/post/161081169345/v500), [npx](https://medium.com/@maybekatz/introducing-npx-an-npm-package-runner-55f7d4bd282b), and [npm ci](https://blog.npmjs.org/post/171556855892/introducing-npm-ci-for-faster-more-reliable).
* Various reusable npm packages, like [pacote](https://npm.im/pacote), [cacache](https://npm.im/cacache), [make-fetch-happen](https://npm.im/make-fetch-happen), and more!
* I launched [WeAllJS](https://wealljs.org) as an experiment in building healthy communities, and wrote the [WeAllJS Code of Conduct](https://wealljs.org/code-of-conduct) for it.
* I launched [package.community](https://package.community) as a place for package manager devs to gather and share notes with each other!
* I wrote [a widely-shared and used article about inclusion of non-binary folks in "women's spaces"](https://medium.com/@maybekatz/on-the-design-of-womens-spaces-72bf8f396dc0)!

### What I'm Working On

* I'm one of the lead developers on [orogene](https://github.com/orogene/orogene), a brand-new JavaScript/Node platform and package manager.
* I admin WeAllJS and package.community and help keep them happy, healthy, inclusive communities.
* I'm getting involved with the Rust ecosystem, and already started writing libraries like [ssri](https://crates.io/crates/ssri), and [cacache](https://github.com/zkat/cacache-rs). I'm looking forward to doing more for the Rust community as I keep learning the language and getting involved with various efforts! Maybe with Cargo?
* I participate in communities, providing mentorship and advice in relevant areas of expertise.

### What Sponsorship Does

Aside from what the tiers get you, sponsoring me enables me to keep finding ways to contribute to communities, both in code/tools, and in community work, and it helps me justify spending time on this outside of the scope of my day job!
