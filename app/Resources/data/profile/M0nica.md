 Hi, I'm Monica! I'm a software engineer who is passionate about making open-source more accessible and building community, online & offline. I enjoy teaching and inspiring other technologists by creating approachable learning material whether through a combination of open-source, articles, [Egghead](https://egghead.io/instructors/monica-powell?af=9b5hrz) tutorials or public speaking. For work, I am currently focused on improving the e-book experience for public libraries through [NYPL-Simplified](https://github.com/NYPL-Simplified/ ) and outside of work I am the organizer/founder of React Ladies, a community for women and non-binary ReactJS developers. 

Every year I look forward to celebrating Hacktoberfest in October ðŸŽƒ as it's a huge opportunity to welcome first-time contributors to open-source.  Last year for Hacktoberfest I organized a React Ladies event to introduce our community to Hacktoberfest and encourage open-source contributions.

**Supporting me on GitHub directly supports my ongoing efforts to create educational web development related-content and contribute to open-source**. Some topics I've written tutorials about have included: automating file creation with JavaScript, creating a Grey's Anatomy themed Lorem Ipsum Generator and adding search functionality to a Gatsby blog. I've also contributed documentation and accessibility related improvements to GatsbyJS, NextJS, ReactJS, freeCodeCamp and dev.to.
