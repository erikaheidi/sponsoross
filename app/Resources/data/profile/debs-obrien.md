Head of Learning and Developer Advocate at NuxtJS, the progressive VueJS framework. Debbie is a Microsoft Most Valuable Professional in developer technologies, Google Developer Expert in web technologies and Cloudinary Media Developer Expert. 

Living in Palma de Mallorca in Spain. My main focus is on Nuxt. The idea is to Nuxtify the world and make it easier and more accessible for everyone in the world to learn and use Nuxt. I plan to create more content and learning materials for Nuxt. Perhaps video content or live streams, workshops or tutorials. There is never enough time in the working week to create all the content I would like to create. It would also be great to reach out to more communities in countries where learning materials are not so easy to find and not always free to use. So much we can do.
