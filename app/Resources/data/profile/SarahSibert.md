I'm Sarah and I'm from the UK but I now live in Portugal.

I use the TALL stack for web development and I'm writing a blog built with it to help other learners at [TALL Tales](https://talltales.xyz/).  I'm also building a simple budgeting app which I hope to release soon.

Sponsorship is important to me because it will help me continue with learning as much as I can and creating new packages and projects.
