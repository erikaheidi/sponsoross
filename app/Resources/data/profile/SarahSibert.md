Hi, I'm Sarah, a web developer from the UK but now living in Portugal.

I program websites mostly in PHP and Laravel and I'm learning the TALL stack . I'm writing a blog built with it to help other learners at [TALL Tales](https://talltales.xyz/).  I'm also building a simple budgeting app which I hope to release soon.

I am also now co-maintainer of Astrotomic - an organisation producing open source software.

Sponsorship is important to me because it will help me continue with learning as much as I can and creating new packages and projects.
