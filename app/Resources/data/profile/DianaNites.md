Hello, I'm Diana. I write and maintain open-source software. Almost all my work is related to the Rust programming language.

I mostly work on lower-level tooling and libraries, and things I think will be useful to me, and others.

I'm currently primarily working on [Parts](https://github.com/DianaNites/parts), a new partition management library, and [new partition management software](https://github.com/DianaNites/parts_manager) making use of it. I also have several other ongoing projects and ideas.

I currently do all of my open-source work in my free time. Sponsoring allows me to put more time and effort into it. Your sponsorship helps me a lot, and means the world to me!
