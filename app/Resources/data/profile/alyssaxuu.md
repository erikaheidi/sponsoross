I am a designer, developer, and entrepreneur with a passion for creating projects that are unique (or experimental), intuitive, and useful.

I've worked on a large variety of projects, such as a [platforming game engine for Figma](https://github.com/alyssaxuu/figma-platformer-engine), the most powerful [screen recorder & annotation tool for Chrome](https://github.com/alyssaxuu/screenity), a [web-based motion graphics editor](https://medium.com/women-make/building-a-web-based-motion-graphics-editor-bd070f8db795), an incredibly minimal and simple to use [javascript library to create flowcharts](https://github.com/alyssaxuu/flowy), a [plugin to convert from Figma to Google Slides](https://github.com/alyssaxuu/figma-to-google-slides), a [design tool to create animated mockups](https://animockup.com), and more.

Currently I'm working on adding new features and functionality to Flowy and Screenity, and creating new open source projects (it's secret, for now at least! ðŸ‘€). Aside from that, I also want to document and be more open about my process behind my projects (for example, like I've done for my [Figma plugin](https://medium.com/women-make/building-a-chrome-extension-to-convert-from-figma-to-google-slides-b98de6603c43) or [Google Sheets CMS](https://blog.usejournal.com/how-to-use-google-sheets-as-a-cms-or-a-database-f9d8e736fdce)).

Sponsorship would help make it more sustainable for me to work on more open source projects and maintain them, so it is greatly appreciated!

Thanks! ðŸ’œ
