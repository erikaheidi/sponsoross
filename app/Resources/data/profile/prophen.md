My work is about creating opportunities for technologists like myself who are just getting started in their tech careers.

I recognize from experience the extra effort it takes to get a great start when you are dealing with financial hardships and a number of non-negotiable adult responsibilities.

When you sponsor me, you allow me the mental space to do my work to the best of my ability.

Thank you ❤️
