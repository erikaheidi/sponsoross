Hey there! I'm Erika Heidi, a dev+ops turned writer. I create educational content for a variety of audiences, in different platforms. In my day job, I write tutorials for DigitalOcean. In my free time, I share tutorials and illustrated guides on [my blog](https://eheidi.dev) and on [dev.to](https://dev.to/erikaheidi). I also like to [present talks](https://youtu.be/l0jb-N5H52A) and [live stream](https://twitch.tv/erikaheidi) occasionally.

I'm very passionate about PHP and the community around it. Lately, I have been working more closely with Laravel and also with pure PHP in command line environments. I enjoy using a minimalist approach in most of the things I create, that's why I built [Minicli](https://github.com/minicli/minicli), one of my favorite projects because it is dependency-free.

Working on open source is quite hard - specially when you have kids! Nobody has the time. But it's a passion I can't let go. Sometimes it's hard to justify it thou - that's why sponsoring open source creators is so important. As a token of my appreciation for sponsors, I'm sharing premium content and free printables on my content platform at [eheidi.dev](https://eheidi.dev). GitHub sponsors have unlimited access to this content and are also featured in my home page.

Thank you all for your support!
