## How sponsorship helps me
While I'm able to make a living from my part-time job at OFN and Part-time paid PhD I do a lot of unpaid OSS work as an open-source designer as well as talk regularly with people on diversity and inclusion. My role is contract and doesn't have holiday or sick pay benefits and runs on unstable funding streams. Sponsorship allows me to have other sources of funding for what I do in OSS.
