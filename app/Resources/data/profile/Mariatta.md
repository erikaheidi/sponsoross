# Why sponsor me

By sponsoring me, you're sponsoring a member of underrepresented group in the open source space. Your sponsorship allows me to continue contributing to Python, give more talks, write more blog posts, provide 1:1: mentorship, and to further build the community. You'll also be helping with my own personal health and wellbeing, avoiding burnout, and take more time for self care.

- [Python Language Summit 2021](https://us.pycon.org/2021/summits/language/), as the co-chair for the third time.

For my contributions to Python, I've received the [Community Service Award](http://pyfound.blogspot.com/2019/02/the-north-star-of-pycascades-core.html) from [Python Software Foundation](https://python.org). I've also been nominated twice for
[Google Open Source Peer Bonus](https://opensource.googleblog.com/2020/04/announcing-2020-first-quarter-google.html) program. I'm a [PSF Fellow member](http://pyfound.blogspot.com/2020/10/python-software-foundation-fellow.html) since 2020. In honor of [Ada Lovelace Day in 2020](https://twitter.com/github/status/1316061242788851712), my story was shared on [GitHub ReadME project](https://github.com/readme/mariatta-wijaya).
