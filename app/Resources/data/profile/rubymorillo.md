## $whoami
I got my start in open source back in 2015 when I began copywriting and copyediting for select projects. From 2017-2019, I was the copywriter and technical writer for [Ruby Together](https://www.rubytogether.org), having contributed docs to [Bundler](https://www.bundler.io) and having updated the monthly updates for Ruby Together and RubyGems. I like sharing [writing and marketing tips for developers on my blog](https://www.stephaniemorillo.co).

Today, I'm driving the content strategy for an upcoming paper to be published by [the Organization for Ethical Source](https://ethicalsource.dev/) and I also publish free study lists on GitHub, which you can find here:

- 📌 [The Pocket UX List](https://github.com/rubymorillo/pocket-ux-list)
- 📌 [The Pocket Data 101 List](https://github.com/rubymorillo/pocket-data-101-list)
- 📌 [The Pocket Scrum Self-Study Guide](https://github.com/rubymorillo/pocket-scrum-self-study-list)
- 📌 [The Pocket Technical Writing List](https://github.com/rubymorillo/pocket-tech-writing-list)
- 📌 [The Pocket Writer Job Board List](https://github.com/rubymorillo/pocket-writer-job-boards-list/)

## Why is sponsorship important?
Sponsorship, no matter the amount, is a way supporters can demonstrate the value our work provides them. It's a way of validating creators, it's a feedback mechanism, and it helps us create sustainably. I aim to share as much as I can to help technologists and do so via Twitter and my GitHub Pocket Lists.

Thank you in advance for checking out my profile,
